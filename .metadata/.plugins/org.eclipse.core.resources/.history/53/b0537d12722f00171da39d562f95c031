	 * Questions: 
	 * You have eight balls all of the same size. 
	 * 7 of them weigh the same, and one of them weighs slightly more. 
	 * How can you find the ball that is heavier by using a balance.
	 * 
	 * You will get an array list of Ball objects all with equal weight except one.
	 * Please use recursion to solve the problem
	 * 
	 * There is a method testCandidateSolution() in
	 * com.sap.octo.interview.solution.test.SolutionTest.java
	 * that you can use to test your solution. Simply run SolutionTest.java
	 * as a JUnit test.
	 * Good Luck!!
